## **Features**

### **Bots**
- **Moonwalk**: Makes the player do a "moonwalk" when pressing both left and right keys by switching the movement direction back and forth.
- **Auto Fire**: Automatically fires your weapon when holding the fire button.
- **Auto Rehook**: After successfully hooking a player, if you keep holding the hook button, it automatically tries to rehook them.
- **Auto Jump Save**: Automatically jumps to avoid going into freeze.
- **Quick Stop**: Stops the player quickly and smoothly by adjusting movement direction to counter their current velocity.
- **Avoid Freeze**: Helps avoid freeze zones by using left/right movement.

### **Protections**
- **Random Timeout Seed**: Generates a new timeout seed before connecting to a server to avoid fingerprinting. Note: You cannot rejoin your old position after timing out with this enabled.

- **Anti AFK**: Prevents being marked as AFK.
- **Kill on Freeze**: Kills your player automatically when you get frozen.
- **Fast Input**: Makes your input feel 1 tick faster (20ms), but this is only a visual effect.
- **Ignore Replay Warnings**: Suppresses warning messages related to TAS replays.
- **Hide Chat Bubble**: Hides the chat bubble so other players don’t know when you are typing.
- **Auto Verify**: Automatically verifies you on whitelist-protected servers like `ger10.ddnet.tw`.

### **Troll**
- **Emote Spam**: Spams random emotes as fast as possible.

### **ID Stealer**
- **Enable**: Copies another player’s name, clan, skin, flag, or eye emote based on your selected options.

### **Silent Walk**
- **Enable**: A funny "exploit" that hides your direction and jump arrows and makes your hook invisible.
